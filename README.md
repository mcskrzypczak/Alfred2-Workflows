But first of all you need to **add** some computers by typing `vnc add`, give name and IP address like on the screenshot below (you **need** to stay with pattern: Name dash IP address and optionally port number after colon → **Living Room-192.168.1.103:5901**):

To **delete** computer from list type `vnc del` and simply select machine:
